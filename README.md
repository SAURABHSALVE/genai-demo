AI ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§æ - The Future of Indian Craftsmanship (Flask Demo)
Welcome to the AI ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§æ interactive demo, a Flask-based web application showcasing a collection of groundbreaking AI concepts designed to empower artisans, enrich cultural heritage, and create magical connections between crafts and people.

This prototype demonstrates how modern technology can be elegantly woven with traditional artistry to create new value and preserve timeless stories.

üöÄ About The Project
This application provides a hands-on experience with several innovative AI features in a beautiful, responsive interface. Users can interact directly with the concepts to understand their potential impact on the world of craftsmanship.

Key Features Demonstrated:

Craft Echoes: A digital soul for crafts that creates new stories based on owner experiences.

Fate Weaving: An AI astrologer that poetically matches crafts to buyers.

Infinity Scaling: A fractal design expander that unlocks new commercial possibilities.

Mela Portal Summoner: An instant virtual fair experience generated from a single photo.

...and several other magical concepts!

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
This project is built with a simple and robust tech stack, making it easy to run and understand.

Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for the backend server and API.

HTML5: For the core structure of the web page.

CSS3: For all the custom styling, animations, and responsive design.

JavaScript: For all client-side interactivity and API communication.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get the demo running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and pip (Python's package installer) installed on your system. You can download them from python.org.

Python 3.x

pip

Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository
If you have cloned this project, navigate into the project directory. If not, you can clone it using:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-kimaya-flask.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-kimaya-flask.git)
cd ai-kimaya-flask

Install Dependencies
The only dependency for this project is Flask. Install it using pip:

pip install Flask

Run the Flask Server
Execute the app.py script from your terminal:

python app.py

View in Your Browser
The application will now be running. Open your web browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

üìÅ Project Structure
The project uses a standard, minimal Flask structure:

/ai-kimaya-flask
|
|-- templates/
|   |-- index.html      # All frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS)
|
|-- app.py              # The Flask server and API logic
|
`-- README.md           # You are here!

app.py: Contains the Python code that runs the server. It serves the index.html file and provides the /api/fate endpoint for the Fate Weaving feature.

templates/index.html: A single file that contains the entire user interface, styling, and client-side JavaScript for all the interactive demos.

Enjoy exploring the future of craftsmanship!
